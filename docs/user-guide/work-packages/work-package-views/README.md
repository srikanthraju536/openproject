# Work packages views

Work packages can be displayed in different views. They include the same work package(s) but just have a different form to display the work packages.

* List view
* Split screen view
* Details view
* Gantt view
* Board view

## Work package list view

The list view shows all work packages in a list with selected attributes in the columns.

Find out how to make changes to the work package list view, e.g. change the titles in the header, filter, group or add dependencies.

## Work package split screen view

If you are in the work package list, click on the blue info icon at the right end of a work package row to open the split screen view.

Also, the split screen view can be activated or de-activated with the **info button** at the top right of the work packages list, next to the Filter.
